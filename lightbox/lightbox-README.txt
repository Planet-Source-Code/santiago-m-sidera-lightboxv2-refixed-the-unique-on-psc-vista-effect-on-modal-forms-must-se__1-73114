LIGHTBOXv2*** */REFIXED/* the UNIQUE on PSC. VISTA EFFECT on modal forms, **MUST SEE**

brightness adjust to the disabled form

now the ability to change brightness (-255 to 255 :: -100% to 100%)
and the ability to change the increment of change (0 to 18)

special thanks to Florian Egel for his "FoxCBMP3.dll" post "Advanced Graphics Routines 3.2 UPDATED  **must see!**" - made this code possible.

"foxcbmp3.dll" was renamed to "lightbox.dll" and embedded into a .res file and is extracted automatically when the application starts.
i used the function "FoxBrightness" to adjust the image.

fixed some errors
sorry for my english, i'm from argentina
